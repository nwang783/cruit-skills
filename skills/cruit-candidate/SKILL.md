# Cruit — Candidate Skill

## Load instructions

The canonical instructions are bundled with this skill:

```text
INSTRUCTIONS.md
```

Read that file first on every run and follow it. If it cannot be loaded, stop and tell
the user the Cruit candidate instructions are unavailable.

## Safety rules

- Do not publish source code, secrets, `.env` files, private keys, email addresses,
  phone numbers, street addresses, or private contact details.
- Never upload unsanitized coding-agent transcripts; only submit scrubbed excerpts the
  user approved.
- Confirm with the user before reviewing folders, publishing a profile, submitting an
  evidence packet, or setting up automation.
